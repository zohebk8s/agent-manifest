"""Pytest configuration for this suite.

Guards a silent failure mode rather than testing anything itself.

pytest puts the source tree on the path, so an in-process import always finds
this tree. A test that shells out does not get that: a plain
``subprocess.run([sys.executable, ...])`` resolves the distribution the normal
way, and with a released wheel also installed it finds site-packages. The
subprocess then exercises a published version while the suite reports a pass,
which is how a tutorial test in this repo family graded against an old schema
and looked green.

CI installs the package editable, so the subprocess resolves back into the tree
and this check is a no-op there. Locally it turns a wrong answer into a loud one.

A package that is not importable from a subprocess at all is fine: that is the
path-only setup, not a shadowing install, and the suite still runs.
