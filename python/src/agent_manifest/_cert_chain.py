"""Generic, algorithm-agnostic X.509 certificate-chain verification.

This is the shared primitive the org's hardware-attestation verifiers build on.
An AMD SEV-SNP VCEK chain (RSA-PSS ``ARK``/``ASK`` + EC ``VCEK``), an Intel TDX
PCK chain (all EC), and a TPM attestation-key chain (per-vendor EK roots, RSA or
EC) are all the same shape: *a leaf-first chain in which each certificate is
issued by the next, up to a trusted root pinned by fingerprint*. The only thing
that differs is the signature algorithm on each link.

:func:`verify_cert_chain` verifies any of them by honoring **each certificate's
own** signature algorithm (ECDSA, RSASSA-PSS, or RSA PKCS#1 v1.5) via
:meth:`cryptography.x509.Certificate.verify_directly_issued_by`, then pins the
chain's final certificate to a caller-supplied trusted root by fingerprint. It
is fail-closed: any broken link or unpinned root raises :class:`CertChainError`.

cmcp and ca2a consume this (via the ``agent-manifest`` PyPI package) instead of
each carrying their own chain verifier; the AMD-specific
:func:`._snp_verify.verify_vcek_chain` is a thin specialisation of it.

        trusted_roots: the roots the caller trusts. The chain's final
            certificate must match one of these by fingerprint.
        root_fingerprint_hash: hash used to compare root fingerprints
            (default SHA-256). The pin is on identity, so any collision-
            resistant hash works as long as it is used consistently.

        ``True`` when every link verifies (honoring each child's own signature

        failure raises so a caller can never mistake a broken chain for a pass.
