"""Revocation CRL endpoint and signed revocation record — issue #14.

The RevocationRecord in _verify.py is the in-memory model. This module adds:
  - Signed revocation records (the revoking authority signs the record)
  - CRL (Certificate Revocation List) endpoint — a JSON-Lines file of records
  - Discovery: .well-known/agent-manifest/revocation endpoint
  - Persistence: file-backed CRL for the SDK-hosted mode

Spec Section 3.7 (added in PR improving the spec) defines the revocation
mechanism. The CRL format follows RFC 5280 conceptually but uses JSON.
