"""Agent Manifest verification engine and FastAPI endpoint.

Two hosting modes (spec Section 5.1 / SPEC-07):
  SDK-hosted:    FastAPI server embedded in the agent process, served over
                 mTLS using the agent's SPIFFE SVID.  Runtime artifact hashes
                 are computed by the trusted component that holds the manifest.
  OPAQUE-hosted: Results are served from hashes pushed by the agent SDK at
                 startup to OPAQUE's attestation service.

The verification engine itself is hosting-agnostic - it takes a Manifest
dict and a set of running artifact hashes and produces a VerificationResult.
The FastAPI router wires the engine to HTTP.

    Checks version compatibility, signature, expiry, revocation, artifact

    per-field status and mismatch details.

    Accepts either envelope, selected by what it is given (ADR-0011):

    - A ``dict`` is a version 0.1 manifest carrying a detached ``signature``
      block, verified over the RFC 8785 pre-image exactly as it always has been.
    - ``bytes`` are a version 0.2 COSE envelope (``COSE_Sign1`` or
      ``COSE_Sign``). The signature is checked over the payload as received,
      and receipts, attestation, and approvals are read from the unprotected
      header after the signature is settled.

    Fail-closed semantics (spec 5.3 - VALID requires a valid signature):

    - A manifest with an unsupported (or missing) ``version`` returns
      ``INCOMPATIBLE_VERSION`` without further processing (spec 2.4).
    - A manifest without a ``signature`` block returns ``SIGNATURE_MISSING``.
    - A signed manifest verified without any ``trusted_keys`` in the context
      returns ``UNVERIFIABLE`` - never ``VALID``.
    - A delegation chain that cannot be verified (no
      ``delegation_public_keys``) is marked ``UNVERIFIABLE`` and the overall
      result is ``UNVERIFIABLE`` (spec 3.4.1 / 5.2).
    - ``enforce_hitl=True`` with no ``hitl_record`` in the manifest is a
      failure (``HitlResult.MISSING`` and a non-VALID overall result).
    - An approval is never ``APPROVED`` unless its own signature verifies with
      a trusted approver key and binds the current manifest ID and scope.

    The ``_envelope`` parameter is internal: it carries an already-appraised
    COSE envelope into the shared pipeline and is not part of the public API.

        The body is the ``COSE_Sign1`` or ``COSE_Sign`` object itself, sent as
        ``Content-Type: application/agent-manifest+cose``. The manifest is
        self-contained - the payload travels inside the signature - so unlike
        the other endpoints there is nothing to look up and no
        ``manifest_id`` to trust from the caller.

        Three deliberate choices, each of which is a security property rather
        than a convenience:

        **The media type is the gate.** Only the exact registered type is
        accepted. A vendor-tree alias is refused (envelope spec section 7:
        two valid type values for one object is the ambiguity ``typ`` exists
        to remove), and so is an absent or guessed type - the server never
        sniffs the body to decide what it is.

        **No key material crosses the wire.** Trust comes from
        ``cose_context``, configured server-side when the router is built.
        A verification service that accepts caller-supplied trusted keys is
        only as trustworthy as its caller, and public keys in a URL or header
        end up in proxy logs and access logs. Without a configured trust
        store this endpoint returns ``UNVERIFIABLE``, never ``VALID``.

        **The body is bounded before it is parsed.** ``Content-Length`` is
        checked when present and the stream is capped regardless, because a
        declared length is attacker-controlled and may lie.

        A malformed or unverifiable envelope is a *verdict*, not a transport
        error: the response is 200 with a non-``VALID`` result. Parser detail
        is not reflected back, so this endpoint cannot be used as an oracle
        for how the decoder behaves.

        Authentication, authorization and rate limiting are deployment
        concerns and are deliberately not implemented here; mount this router
        behind them (spec 5.1: mTLS with the agent's SPIFFE SVID).
