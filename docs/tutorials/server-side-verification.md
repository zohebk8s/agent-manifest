# Server-Side Manifest Verification

This tutorial covers the relying-party side: a service that receives requests from agents and needs to decide whether to trust them. After completing it you will be able to:

- Verify an agent manifest programmatically in any Python service
- Mount a FastAPI verification router exposing `/verify` and `/revocation-status` endpoints
- Gate requests with HTTP middleware using the manifest result
- Read every field of `VerificationResult` and know what to act on
- Configure CRL checking via `RevocationStore` or `FileCRL`

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install "agent-manifest[server]"
```

---

## What verification checks

The verifier checks six things in order, stopping at the first hard failure:

1. **Revocation**  -  is this manifest ID in the revocation store?
2. **Validity window**  -  does the current time satisfy `issued_at <= now < expires_at`?
3. **Artifact hashes**  -  do the hashes in the manifest match what is actually running?
4. **Delegation chain**  -  is every hop signed by its parent?
5. **HITL record**  -  if approval was required, is a valid, unexpired one present?
6. **Attestation**  -  if `enforce_attestation=True`, was hardware attestation verified?

---

## Programmatic verification in middleware

Use this pattern when you control the call site and want to act on the result in application code.

```python
from agent_manifest._verify import (
    OverallResult,
    RevocationStore,
    VerificationContext,
    verify_manifest,
)

# Build once at startup, share across requests
revocation_store = RevocationStore()
ctx = VerificationContext(enforce_attestation=True, enforce_hitl=False)

result = verify_manifest(manifest_dict, ctx, revocation_store)

if result.result != OverallResult.VALID:
    raise PermissionError(f"Agent manifest invalid: {result.result}")
```

### Supplying runtime artifact hashes

Pass hashes for any artifacts you can observe at runtime. Fields left as `None` in the context are skipped and return `FieldResult.NOT_BOUND`, not a mismatch.

`NOT_BOUND` applies only to observations omitted from the trusted runtime
context. It does not make required claims optional in the signed manifest:
`verify_manifest()` rejects a manifest missing `manifest_id`, `agent_id`,
`issued_at`, `expires_at`, or `artifacts` as a schema mismatch before appraisal.
For legacy v0.1 compatibility, a missing `issuer` is rejected when
`trusted_key_issuers` authorization is configured.

`trusted_key_issuers` defaults to an empty map, and while it is empty
`verify_manifest()` performs no issuer-key authorization at all: `signature.key_id`
names a key, and nothing checks that the key is authorized for the manifest's
`issuer`. A `VALID` result from a default context is a statement that the signature
verifies under a key you trusted, not that the key belongs to the issuer the
manifest names. Populate the map for any deployment where the issuer and the
attested subject are not the same party. The open question of whether the
specification should require this is tracked in issue #325.

```python
import hashlib

with open("system_prompt.txt") as f:
    prompt_text = f.read()

ctx = VerificationContext(
    system_prompt_hash="sha256:" + hashlib.sha256(prompt_text.encode()).hexdigest(),
    model_version="claude-sonnet-4-5-20251022",
    tool_catalog_hash="sha256:e3b0c44...",
    enforce_hitl=True,
    enforce_attestation=False,
)
result = verify_manifest(manifest_dict, ctx, revocation_store)
```

---

## Mounting verification endpoints with FastAPI

Use this when you want to expose verification as an HTTP service, for example a sidecar that other services query.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from agent_manifest._verify import create_router, RevocationStore

app = FastAPI()
manifest_store: dict = {}   # manifest_id -> manifest dict
revocation_store = RevocationStore()

app.include_router(create_router(manifest_store, revocation_store), prefix="/agent")

# GET /agent/verify?manifest_id=...&enforce_hitl=true
# GET /agent/revocation-status?manifest_id=...
```

**Verify a manifest:**

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/agent/verify?manifest_id=018f4a3b-2c1d-7e5f-a8b9-0d1e2f3a4b5c"
```

```json
{
  "verification_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "manifest_id": "018f4a3b-2c1d-7e5f-a8b9-0d1e2f3a4b5c",
  "verified_at": "2026-06-07T10:00:00Z",
  "result": "VALID",
  "signature_verified": false,
  "attestation_verified": false,
  "fields_verified": {
    "system_prompt": "NOT_BOUND",
    "policy_bundle": "NOT_BOUND",
    "tool_manifest": "NOT_BOUND",
    "model_identity": "NOT_BOUND",
    "rag_corpus": "NOT_BOUND",
    "memory_baseline": "NOT_BOUND",
    "decision_trace": "NOT_BOUND",
    "supply_chain": "NOT_BOUND",
    "delegation_chain": "NOT_PRESENT",
    "hitl_record": "NOT_REQUIRED"
  },
  "mismatch_details": []
}
```

**Enforce HITL and attestation via query params:**

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/agent/verify?manifest_id=<id>&enforce_hitl=true&enforce_attestation=true"
```

---

## Configuring minimum attestation level

`VerificationContext.enforce_attestation=True` requires that `attestation_verified` is `True` in the result. Manifests without hardware attestation return `ATTESTATION_UNAVAILABLE`.

In production, reject any result where `attestation_verified` is `False`:

```python
ctx = VerificationContext(enforce_attestation=True)
result = verify_manifest(manifest_dict, ctx, revocation_store)

if not result.attestation_verified:
    raise PermissionError(
        "Production requires hardware attestation (Level 2+). "
        "Use SEVSNPProvider, TDXProvider, or OPAQUEProvider."
    )
```

## Reading `VerificationResult` and acting on each outcome

| `result` value | Meaning | Recommended action |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| `VALID` | All checks passed | Allow the request |
| `REVOKED` | Manifest is in the revocation list | Block immediately; open an incident |
| `EXPIRED` | `expires_at` is in the past | Block; agent must re-issue the manifest |
| `MISMATCH` | One or more artifact hashes differ | Block; agent may have drifted or been tampered with |
| `ATTESTATION_UNAVAILABLE` | `enforce_attestation` set but no attestation present | Block in prod, warn in dev |
| `INCOMPLETE` | `strict_artifact_verification` set and bound fields lack runtime hashes | Block |
| `INCOMPATIBLE_VERSION` | Manifest spec version not supported | Upgrade the SDK |

Inspect `mismatch_details` to identify which artifacts failed:

```python
if result.result == OverallResult.MISMATCH:
    for detail in result.mismatch_details:
        print(f"  [{detail.field}] expected={detail.expected_hash} got={detail.actual_hash}")
```

## FastAPI middleware that gates requests on manifest ID

Use the `X-Agent-Manifest-ID` header to identify the calling agent. The middleware verifies the manifest before routing to your handler.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from agent_manifest._verify import (
    OverallResult,
    RevocationStore,
    VerificationContext,
    verify_manifest,
)

app = FastAPI()
manifest_store: dict = {}
revocation_store = RevocationStore()

MANIFEST_ID_HEADER = "x-agent-manifest-id"

@app.middleware("http")
async def verify_agent_manifest(request: Request, call_next):
    manifest_id = request.headers.get(MANIFEST_ID_HEADER)
    if manifest_id:
        manifest = manifest_store.get(manifest_id)
        if manifest is None:
            return JSONResponse(
                status_code=403,
                content={"detail": f"Unknown manifest: {manifest_id}"},
            )
        ctx = VerificationContext()
        result = verify_manifest(manifest, ctx, revocation_store)
        if result.result != OverallResult.VALID:
            return JSONResponse(
                status_code=403,
                content={
                    "detail": result.result,
                    "mismatch_details": [d.model_dump() for d in result.mismatch_details],
                },
            )
    return await call_next(request)

@app.post("/execute")
async def execute(request: Request):
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

---

## Configuring CRL checking

Wire `FileCRL` into the `RevocationStore` at startup so every `verify_manifest()` call checks revocation.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from agent_manifest._revocation import FileCRL
from agent_manifest._verify import RevocationRecord, RevocationStore

crl = FileCRL(Path("/data/revocations.jsonl"))
revocation_store = RevocationStore()

for rec in crl.all_records():
    revocation_store.revoke(RevocationRecord(
        manifest_id=rec.manifest_id,
        revoked_at=rec.revoked_at,
        reason=rec.reason,
        revoked_by=rec.revoked_by,
    ))
```

`RevocationStore` is in-memory. For a long-running service, reload the CRL periodically or replace it with a database-backed store.
