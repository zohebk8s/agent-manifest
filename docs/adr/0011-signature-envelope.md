# ADR-0011: The manifest is a signed document, not a JWT/JOSE profile

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-07-26 (part 2 decided 2026-07-27)
**Spec section**: Section 2.3 (Canonical Serialization), Section 3.6 (Manifest Signature)

## Context

A recurring question in standards conversations is: *why is this not just a JWT extension?* The question deserves a structural answer, and answering it exposed a decision this project has never actually made.

### What we sign today

The spec describes the signed manifest as "JWS" in two places (Section 2.2 lifecycle table, and the `pack_signature` note in Section 5). That description is wrong, and this ADR's companion change removes it. The implementation has never used JOSE:

- The SDK's only cryptographic dependency is `cryptography`. No JOSE library is present.
- `signing_pre_image()` returns the RFC 8785 canonical bytes of a fixed subset of top-level fields (`SIGNED_FIELDS`), with `hitl_record.approvals` normalized to `[]`.
- The result is a raw Ed25519 (or ML-DSA-65, or both) signature carried in a bespoke detached JSON `signature` object.

So the envelope is neither JOSE nor COSE. It is a third thing: canonical JSON plus a detached signature object, specified only by us. That is the weakest of the available positions for a project whose stated goal is a canonical standard, and it is the real subject of this ADR.

### What the envelope has to carry

The manifest is not shaped like a bearer token:

- Ten artifact bindings, not a claim set about a caller.
- Multiple independent signers. The issuer signs the manifest; each HITL approver signs their own approval; each delegation hop is signed by its principal; hardware attestation is appended after signing and is deliberately outside the issuer signature.
- A 90-day default lifetime, versus the minutes-to-hours life of an access token.
- A transparency log inclusion proof attached *after* signing (Section 3.6 ordering rules).

### The strongest form of the counter-argument

EAT, [RFC 9711](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9711.html) (Standards Track, April 2025), is a real IETF attestation-token format in the JWT/CWT family. It supports nested tokens for composite multi-subsystem devices (Section 4.2.18.3) and Detached EAT Bundles for claims carried outside the token (Section 5). An honest reading is that an IETF-blessed *token* can, in principle, express multi-artifact and detached attestation. Any rebuttal that rests on "JWT cannot do this" is wrong and will be dismantled by anyone who knows EAT.

### What comparable standards actually chose

The pattern is not "tokens versus documents" in the abstract. It splits cleanly by object type:

| Standard | Object | Envelope |
|---|---|---|
| EAT (RFC 9711) | Attestation token about a caller | JWT / CWT profile |
| SCITT ([RFC 9943](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9943.html), June 2026) | Supply-chain signed statement plus transparency receipt | COSE_Sign1, mandated |
| in-toto / SLSA | Multi-subject build attestation | DSSE, which explicitly rejected JWS |
| C2PA | Multi-assertion content provenance | JUMBF container, `COSE_Sign1_Tagged` claim signature |

SCITT is the closest analog to what Agent Manifest is: it requires that "Signed Statements produced by Issuers must be COSE_Sign1 messages," treats the payload as content-agnostic (including detached payloads), and carries COSE Receipts as proofs in the unprotected header. That is our model, down to the Rekor-style log entry in Section 3.6.

The DSSE authors documented why they declined to profile JWS: it "has a history of vulnerable implementations due to the complexity and lack of specificity in the RFC"; implementations fail to check that the algorithm matches the public key type or to validate the certificate chain root; and canonicalization is "an unnecessarily large attack surface." Their Pre-Authentication Encoding exists to bind `payloadType` and `payload` unambiguously so that signer and verifier cannot disagree about what was signed.

### We have already shipped one of those bugs

This is not a theoretical concern for us. Section 3.6 excludes the entire `signature` block from the signing pre-image, so `signature.algorithm` was unauthenticated, and the verifier never compared it against the signed `crypto_profile`. Until 0.6.0, a manifest declaring the post-quantum profile verified `VALID` on a classical-only Ed25519 signature. We fixed it with an explicit cross-check. COSE_Sign1 places `alg` in the *protected* header, where it is covered by the signature; the entire class of bug is structurally absent rather than patched after the fact.

## Decision

Two parts. The first is settled; the second is what this ADR asks for a decision on.

**1. Agent Manifest is a signed document, not a bearer token, and it composes with the token layer rather than competing with it.** EAT is the right answer for "who is calling, right now, and what is their attestation evidence." An EAT (or any platform attestation token) is a valid *input* to a manifest's attestation block. The manifest itself is the durable, multi-signer, hardware-bound record of what the agent *was*. We will not profile JWS as the manifest envelope.

**2. The envelope moves to COSE_Sign1** (Option A below), aligning with SCITT rather than continuing to specify a bespoke canonical-JSON envelope. Decided 2026-07-27. This is a breaking change, lands in spec v0.2, and is sequenced in "Migration" below. Section 3.6 of v0.1 remains normative for the current envelope until v0.2 ships.

### What COSE_Sign1 actually buys

Three concrete properties, not just alignment for its own sake:

1. **The signed bytes travel with the signature.** COSE_Sign1 signs a payload as-is, so a verifier never re-serializes anything to check a signature. RFC 8785 stays as the *producer-side* determinism rule and as the basis of the manifest hash bound into hardware `REPORT_DATA`, but it stops being an input to verification. That removes canonicalize-before-verify, which is the specific attack surface DSSE cites.
2. **`alg` is in the protected header, covered by the signature.** The bug we shipped and fixed in 0.6.0, where `signature.algorithm` sat outside the pre-image and could be rewritten, cannot be expressed in this envelope.
3. **Receipts attach where SCITT puts them.** A COSE Receipt in the unprotected header is exactly the `transparency_log_entry`-after-signing ordering that Section 3.6 already describes in prose.

### The post-quantum profile is not a blocker

This was the main technical risk when the migration was first considered, and it has since cleared. [RFC 9964](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9964.html) (Standards Track, May 2026) registers ML-DSA for both JOSE and COSE with final IANA code points: **ML-DSA-65 is COSE `alg` -49**, and the AKP key type is COSE key type 7. Ed25519 uses the long-established `EdDSA` (-8). Both profiles therefore have stable, registered identifiers, and there is no need to pin provisional code points or hold the post-quantum profile back on the old envelope.

The one construction with no standard answer is **hybrid**. COSE has no single-signature hybrid mode, so `hybrid-Ed25519-ML-DSA-65` becomes either two COSE_Sign1 structures over the same payload or one `COSE_Sign` with two signers. That choice is deferred to the v0.2 spec work and should follow whatever draft-ietf-pquip guidance exists at the time.

## Rationale

Deciding by precedent rather than by capability is what makes the position defensible. The question is not whether a JWS or JWT profile *could* carry ten artifact bindings, because EAT shows something in that family can. The question is what every directly comparable multi-artifact, multi-signer, transparency-logged provenance standard chose when it faced this exact decision, and the answer is unanimous: a COSE or DSSE document envelope, never a JWS profile.

Our current envelope is worse than either branch of that fork. It has the two properties DSSE names as reasons to avoid JWS (canonicalization before verification, and no authenticated payload-type or algorithm binding) while also lacking what JOSE and COSE both have: a specification other people implement, independent test suites, and a body of review. Being idiosyncratic is affordable for an internal format and expensive for a proposed standard.

The counter-consideration is real: the canonical-JSON envelope is shipped, hardware-validated on SEV-SNP and TDX, and consumed by cmcp and ca2a through the published package. None of that is throwaway work, and Option B is a legitimate choice if the cost of churn outweighs the standards-path benefit. What is not legitimate is leaving the question unanswered, because a reviewer will find the mismatch between "SCITT-style transparency log" and "envelope of our own invention" and read the silence as an oversight.

## Alternatives considered

**Option A: COSE_Sign1 (chosen).** Aligns with SCITT, C2PA, and the direction of RATS. `alg` moves into the protected header and is covered by the signature. Receipts attach in the unprotected header, matching what we already do with `transparency_log_entry`. Cost: a CBOR dependency, a second signing and verification path, new conformance vectors, and a spec version bump. Consumers on 0.x break unless we support both envelopes through a deprecation window.

**Option B: keep the canonical-JSON envelope and close the DSSE-cited gaps normatively.** Specify in Section 3.6 that the algorithm identifier is bound (either inside the pre-image or by a mandatory cross-check against `crypto_profile`, which 0.6.0 now implements), that an authenticated payload-type indicator is part of the pre-image, and that verifiers must reject unknown or absent algorithm identifiers rather than defaulting. Cheapest path, keeps every current consumer working, and is defensible as long as it is written down. Cost: SCITT profiling later becomes a second migration, and we carry the burden of arguing for a bespoke format in every standards conversation.

**Option C: DSSE.** Solves payload-type binding and avoids canonicalization, and is proven by in-toto and SLSA. But it is not what SCITT mandates, so it does not buy the alignment that is the whole point of moving.

**Option D: profile JWS/JOSE properly.** What the question actually asks for. Rejected on precedent, not capability: no comparable provenance standard took this route, and DSSE documented specific implementation hazards. It would also make Agent Manifest look like an access-token extension, which is exactly the category error the project exists to correct.

**Option E: status quo, undocumented.** Rejected. The current state is a bespoke envelope described in the spec by the wrong name.

## Migration

Sequenced so that nothing breaks before there is something to migrate to. Tracked as a GitHub issue; each phase is its own PR.

**Phase 1 - specify (spec v0.2, no code). Done, 2026-07-27:** [`spec/agent-manifest-cose-envelope-v0.2.md`](https://github.com/agentrust-io/agent-manifest/blob/main/spec/agent-manifest-cose-envelope-v0.2.md). Protected header carries `alg` (`EdDSA` -8, `ML-DSA-65` -49 per RFC 9964), `kid`, `content type` (3), and `typ` (16, RFC 9596); the payload is the RFC 8785 canonical JSON of the manifest, inline; the receipt attaches as `receipts` (unprotected label 394, RFC 9942). Hybrid is one `COSE_Sign` with two signers rather than two `COSE_Sign1`, so the shared payload is structural instead of an application rule. Media types are `application/agent-manifest+json` for the payload and `application/agent-manifest+cose` for the object, both standards-tree, registration pending. v0.1 Section 3.6 stays normative for v0.1 manifests.

The specification work surfaced a benefit beyond alignment: three awkward v0.1 mechanisms collapse into the unprotected header. The fixed `signed_fields` list and its coverage table, the `hitl_record.approvals` normalization rule, and the `transparency_log_entry` five-step ordering all exist because v0.1 has no defined home for data that attaches after signing. COSE does, so all three are deleted rather than ported.

**Phase 2 - implement behind a version gate.** Add COSE signing and verification alongside the existing path, selected by manifest `version`, not by a flag. A v0.1 manifest keeps verifying exactly as it does today; there is no reinterpretation of existing records. New dependency: a CBOR/COSE library, which is the first non-`cryptography` crypto dependency the SDK has taken and should be reviewed as such.

**Phase 3 - conformance.** COSE variants of the `AM-VEC-*` vectors, including negative cases that only this envelope can express (tampered protected header, `alg` substitution). The vectors are the portable contract, so they gate any other-language SDK.

**Phase 4 - consumers.** cmcp and ca2a consume the verifier through the published package; they move when v0.2 verification is released, not before. The TypeScript SDK is written against COSE from the start rather than ported to the v0.1 envelope and migrated twice.

**Phase 5 - deprecation.** Announce an end date for issuing v0.1 manifests. Verification of v0.1 records stays supported through the retention window, because manifests are audit records with a 90-day life and regulated retention beyond it.

## Consequences

- Sections 2.2 and 5 no longer describe the manifest signature as "JWS." That correction landed with this ADR.
- The SDK takes a CBOR dependency it has so far avoided, and carries two signing paths for the length of the deprecation window. That is the price of the alignment and it is paid in maintenance, not in verification risk, since the paths are selected by manifest version.
- RFC 8785 is not going away. It remains the producer-side determinism rule (ADR-0001) and the basis of the manifest hash bound into hardware attestation. What changes is that it stops being something a verifier must reproduce byte-for-byte to check a signature.
- Positioning follows the envelope: Agent Manifest becomes describable as the agent-layer profile of SCITT, referencing OpenSSF Model Signing for the model artifact and SCITT receipts for transparency instead of restating them. Adjacent efforts become dependencies rather than competitors.
- The standards answer is now: EAT and JWT for the attestation-token input, a COSE_Sign1 document for the manifest, and no competition between the layers.
