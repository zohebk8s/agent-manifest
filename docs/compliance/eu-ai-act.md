# EU AI Act compliance mapping

This page maps agent-manifest capabilities to EU AI Act obligations for high-risk AI systems. It is written for compliance officers and auditors, not developers.

**Status:** GPAI model obligations apply since **August 2025**, and **Article 50 transparency duties since 2 August 2026** (see below - the manifest does not satisfy them). Under the current provisional legislative timeline (the digital omnibus amendments), high-risk AI system obligations are expected to apply from around **December 2027**, and AI systems embedded in regulated products from around **August 2028**. These dates remain subject to the legislative process - verify against the [official AI Act timeline](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/implementation-timeline/) before relying on them. Obligations already in force today (e.g. DORA for financial entities, HIPAA for US healthcare) are unaffected by this timeline.

Everything on this page below Article 50 maps to the **high-risk** obligations, which are the deferred ones. Article 50 is the one in force now.

## Article 50  -  Transparency obligations *(in force since 2 August 2026)*

> *AI systems intended to interact directly with natural persons shall be designed so that the person is informed they are interacting with an AI system, unless obvious. Providers of systems generating synthetic content shall mark the output in a machine-readable form.*

**What agent-manifest provides: nothing yet.** This is stated plainly because Article 50 is the obligation an auditor can hold a deployment to today, and a mapping page that quietly omits it reads as coverage.

| Article 50 paragraph | Obligation | Status |
|----------------------|------------|--------|
| 50(1) | Inform persons they are interacting with an AI system | No manifest field. Disclosure is delivered at runtime; AGT's `agent_os.transparency` interceptor enforces it at the tool-call boundary. |
| 50(2) | Mark synthetic output as artificially generated, machine-readably | No manifest field. A mark any party can strip does not meet the requirement, so binding the mark to the attested agent that produced the output is the intended design. Not built. |
| 50(3) | Inform persons exposed to emotion recognition or biometric categorisation | No manifest field. Enforced at runtime by the same AGT interceptor. A manifest whose approved scope covers biometric tooling is evidence the deployment is in scope. |
| 50(4) | Deepfake and public-interest text disclosure | No manifest field. Same gap as 50(2). |

Article 50 applies regardless of whether the system is high-risk under Annex III. Do not present a manifest as Article 50 evidence.

## Article 9  -  Risk management system

> *Providers of high-risk AI systems shall establish a risk management system* that identifies and estimates known and foreseeable risks.

**What agent-manifest provides**

The manifest carries a structured risk assessment in `hitl_record.approvals[].approved_scope.risk_tier` (low / medium / high / critical), together with the artifacts the assessment covers and conditions attached to the approval. Each approval is signed by the approver's key, and the HITL requirement itself (`hitl_record.required`) is covered by the issuer signature, making the recorded risk assessment tamper-evident.

```json
{
  "hitl_record": {
    "required": true,
    "approvals": [{
      "approver_id": "mailto:risk-officer@example.com",
      "approved_scope": {
        "artifacts": ["tool_manifest", "policy_bundle"],
        "risk_tier": "high",
        "approval_duration_seconds": 7776000,
        "conditions": ["Processes financial decisions affecting natural persons"]
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

The signed manifest is the risk management record. An auditor can verify that the assessment was made before deployment (manifest `issued_at`) and has not been altered since.

---

## Article 12  -  Record-keeping

> *High-risk AI systems shall automatically log events* to enable post-deployment review.

**What agent-manifest provides**

Every manifest includes an `artifacts.decision_trace` section with a Merkle `audit_chain_root`. Each decision appended to the trace is a leaf in a tamper-evident Merkle tree. An auditor can present any decision and verify it was recorded before a given audit_chain_root  -  without access to any other decisions.

The audit chain root is deterministic and reproducible: losing the chain does not lose the ability to verify past roots.

---

## Article 13  -  Transparency and provision of information to deployers

> *High-risk AI systems shall be designed so that their operation is sufficiently transparent* to enable deployers to interpret and use the system's output appropriately.

**What agent-manifest provides**

| Article 13 requirement | Manifest field |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Identity of the provider | `issuer` (SPIFFE URI of the signing authority) |
| Identity of the AI system | `agent_id` (SPIFFE URI of the agent role) |
| Model used | `artifacts.model_identity.provider`, `.model_id`, `.version` |
| System prompt used | `artifacts.system_prompt.hash` (SHA-256, content-addressed) |
| Tools the system can invoke | `artifacts.tool_manifest.tools[]` |

All fields are signed by the issuer key. A deployer can verify the signed manifest and confirm exactly what model, prompt, and tools are in use  -  without trusting the agent's self-report.

---

## Article 14  -  Human oversight

> *High-risk AI systems shall be designed so that they can be effectively overseen by natural persons during the period in which the AI system is in use.*

**What agent-manifest provides**

The `hitl_record` field records human approval events:

```json
{
  "hitl_record": {
    "required": true,
    "approvals": [{
      "approval_id": "019236ab-0000-7000-8000-000000000031",
      "approver_id": "mailto:alice@example.com",
      "approver_identity_type": "email",
      "approver_role": "payments-security-officer",
      "approved_at": "2026-06-01T09:15:00Z",
      "approved_scope": {
        "artifacts": ["tool_manifest"],
        "risk_tier": "high",
        "approval_duration_seconds": 28800,
        "conditions": ["execute_payment", "submit_regulatory_filing"]
      },
      "approval_signature": "...",
      "approval_method": "hardware-key",
      "evidence_uri": "https://approvals.example.com/records/..."
    }]
  }
}
```

The signature is made over `{manifest_id, approved_at, approved_scope, approver_id}` by the approver's key. This proves:

- A named human reviewed and approved this specific agent
- The approval covers only the declared scope
- The approval has a bounded validity window
- The approval cannot be forged without the approver's key

**Conformance level requirement:** Article 14 HITL requires Level 1+ for high-risk AI systems. Level 0 (software-only) manifests without hardware attestation must not be deployed in high-risk contexts without an accompanying HITL record.

---

## Article 17  -  Quality management system

> *Providers shall put in place a quality management system* that ensures compliance with this Regulation.

**What agent-manifest provides**

Signed artifact bindings create a quality record: the model hash, prompt hash, and tool catalog hash are locked at issuance. Any deviation from the approved configuration produces a manifest verification failure (`MISMATCH` result), giving the quality management system a reliable signal that the deployed agent differs from the approved one.

The issuer key rotation procedure (see [Tutorial: Revocation and key rotation](../tutorials/revocation-and-key-rotation.md)) documents the governance process for key management, satisfying the quality management system's documentation requirement.

## Conformance level guidance for high-risk AI

The levels are defined in section 8.1 of the specification. They are not a hardware ladder: the level says what is bound and attested, and the choice of TEE sits inside Level 1.

| Conformance level | What it requires | Recommended for |
|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 0  -  Software-only | All artifact bindings, standard crypto, transparency log publication. No TEE. | Development, staging, non-regulated systems |
| 1  -  TEE-attested | Level 0 plus a TEE attestation block, `audit_key_sealed: true`, and a hardware-verified `container_image_digest`. TPM 2.0, AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX all satisfy this; they differ in the strength of the root, not in the level. | Enterprise production |
| 2  -  Full stack | Level 1 plus all 10 artifacts bound, HITL approvals present, delegation chain for multi-agent, Phase 2 cMCP, `minimum_retention_days >= 180`, and a declared drift policy. | High-risk AI under Article 6(2), Annex III |
| 3  -  Post-quantum | Level 2 plus ML-DSA-65, ML-KEM-768, SHAKE-256, and a private Sigstore instance supporting ML-DSA-65. | Sovereign, classified, long-horizon financial |

For high-risk AI systems under Article 6(2), Annex III, **Level 2 or above is recommended**, because Article 12 record-keeping and Article 14 human oversight need the artifacts that Level 2 requires to be bound rather than merely present. Level 1 is a reasonable interim where the full artifact set is not yet in place, provided a compensating HITL control is documented.

Within Level 1, the root of trust still matters for what a verifier can conclude: SEV-SNP and TDX attest a confidential VM directly, while a TPM 2.0 quote attests the boot chain of a VM the host can still see into. Azure confidential VMs are a third case, vTPM-rooted rather than direct-silicon, and are documented in `LIMITATIONS.md`.
